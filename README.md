# TICK-TACK-TOE-GAME
I made this small game using HTML, CSSS, JAVASCRIPT &amp; JQUERY.....

How TO Run this Code?

First you have to download the ZIP file
Then you have to unzip in any folder you want
I already put jquery file in the folder so there is no need to download again or copy the link and paste it in the html file
All coding is done if you want to change te design and want to make it more attractive it is up to you
You just have to open game.html file in your favorite browser and run the game
Thanks....
